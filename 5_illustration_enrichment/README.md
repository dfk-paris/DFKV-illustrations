# Illustration metadata enrichment

We now have all the illustrations that are present in our corpus. We want to make the dataset more interesting by adding some metadata to the illustrations. 

The proposed steps are :

- Finding the category of the object illustrated
- Associate illustrations with descriptors from researchers
- Find topics discussed around the illustrations
- Find name/authors of artworks
