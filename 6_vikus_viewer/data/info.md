# Deutsch-Franz√∂sische Kunstvermittlung

The illustrations are coming from German and French journals, exhibitions reviews, books, etc. The journals were all curated because they talk in some way about art in the other country. The art itself is mostly paintings, but also sculpture, architecture, arts and crafts, and graphic arts. The databases do not claim to be complete.

The illustrations are automatically extracted from the journals. All the work done is explained and accessible [here](https://github.com/dfk-paris/DFKV-illustrations).
