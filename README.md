# DFKV illustrations - Internship Project

For the 5 months of my internship at DFK Paris, I am working on one of their curated database, called *Deutsch-Französische Kunstvermittlung*. An overview of the global project is available [here](https://dfk-paris.org/fr/research-project/curation-de-donnees-lexemple-de-la-base-de-donnees-deutsch-franzoesische). I am mainly focusing on the role and place of illustrations in Franco-German art mediation between 1871 and 1960, using Computer Vision and Data Visualisation tools to work with the documents.

## Database Description



## Folder organization

The folders are organized in chronological order. In each of the subsection, you will find a notebook or another README.md that explains in details the steps undertaken and discussions about them. Organisation of the repository :
